# 🛠️ Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
[**Mail track for Gmail**](https://mailtrack.email/) is offered in two versions, both designed to work smoothly within Gmail and Google Workspace environments.

\
The product includes two independent versions — a [**Google Workspace Add-on** ](https://support.mailtrack.email/google-workspace-add-on/installation)and a [**Chrome Extension**](https://support.mailtrack.email/chrome-extension/installation) — each offering the same reliable tracking experience.

If you’re not sure [which one to choose](https://support.mailtrack.email/documentation/faq#should-i-use-chrome-extension-or-google-workspace-add-on), the **Google Workspace Add-on** provides the most seamless integration for most users.\
You can switch to the Chrome Extension later if you prefer a browser-based setup.

PS: In a hurry? Desktop = [Chrome Extension](../chrome-extension/installation.md), mobile = [Google Workspace add-on](../google-workspace-add-on/installation.md)
