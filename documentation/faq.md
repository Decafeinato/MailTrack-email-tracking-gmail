<summary>Should I use Chrome Extension or Google Workspace add-on?</summary>

If you plan to use Mail Track for Gmail **on your desktop, use the Chrome extension**: the integration with Gmail provide a seamless user experience.&#x20;

If you want to send tracked emails **from your mobile, use the Google Workspace add-on** (directly from the Gmail IOS or Android App).&#x20;

In the end, these tools are connected, so you can use the two of them!&#x20;

**If any doubt start with the Chrome Extension**
