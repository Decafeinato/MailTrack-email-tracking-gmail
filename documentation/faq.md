<summary>Should I use Chrome Extension or Google Workspace add-on?</summary>

If you plan to use Mail Track for Gmail **on your desktop, use the Chrome extension**: the integration with Gmail provide a seamless user experience.&#x20;

If you want to send tracked emails **from your mobile, use the Google Workspace add-on** (directly from the Gmail IOS or Android App).&#x20;

In the end, these tools are connected, so you can use the two of them!&#x20;

**If any doubt start with the Chrome Extension**

<summary>The add-on installation seems to be successful but I can't find the shortcut in my Gmail inbox</summary>

This issue is affecting all Google Add-ons, it occurs when you have multiple accounts signed in under the same Google Chrome Profile.

An easy workaround is to open a private window, sign in to the Google account you want, and then proceed to the installation.
