### How to Enable the Chrome Extension

Once you’ve installed Mailtrack from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore), it integrates automatically into Gmail.

To activate tracking:

1. Open your **Gmail inbox**.
2. Look for the **Mail Track checkmark icon** in the top bar of Gmail (next to the search box).
3. Click the icon to open the quick menu.
4. Switch **Mailtrack** to the **ON** position.
5. Optional:
   * Enable **Track emails by default** to automatically track all outgoing emails.
   * Turn on **Invisible Tracker** if you prefer your recipients not to see the Mailtrack signature. ([_Pro_ ](https://mailtrack-billing.web.app/pay)_feature_).

### Using Mailtrack in Gmail

Once enabled, Mailtrack automatically tracks emails you send from Gmail.\
You’ll see the familiar checkmarks appear next to each sent email:

#### ☑️☑️**Two transparent checkmarks — Email sent**

Mailtrack successfully sent your message.

#### ✅✅ **Two green checkmarks — Email opened**

Your email has been **opened** by the recipient.

### 🔍 Search by Recipient

Mailtrack now supports **“Search by Recipient”**, allowing you to quickly find all tracked emails sent to a specific person — directly inside Gmail.

You can search by:

* **Email address**
* **Subject line**

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/search by recepient.gif" %}

Just type the recipient's email in the search bar, and you’ll see all tracked messages associated with it.

This makes it easy to:

* review engagement history,
* and track conversations with important recipients.
