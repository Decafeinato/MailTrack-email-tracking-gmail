Adding or removing mail tracking from Mail Track Chrome extension
{% endembed %}

## Start tracking

With the Mail Track for Gmail Chrome extension, the process of tracking an email is straightforward:

1. Create a draft, and the tracker will be added automatically
2. A popup will appear in the top right corner of the current tab, to confirm that the email is tracked.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the confirmation popup doesn't appear, check that [Mail Track for Gmail is enabled](settings.md) and that you activated the [tracking by default](settings.md)
{% endhint %}

## Cancel tracking

At this stage, **you can also remove the tracker**:  simply click on it.

For the invisible tracker, there is a button with the icon of Mail Track at the bottom of the draft window:
