# 👋 Welcome to Mail Track for Gmail

## Overview

[**Mail Track for Gmail**](https://mailtrack.email/) helps you know exactly when your emails have been opened and read.\
It’s a lightweight, privacy-conscious tool that integrates directly into Gmail and provides real-time tracking visibility.



✔️Follow up when an email has been opened but not yet answered.

✔️Keep notifications on to stay aware of important reads.

✔️Review tracking activity periodically to understand engagement patterns.

✔️Keep communication natural — tracking is a tool, not pressure.



Mailtrack is available as a [**Google Workspace Add-on**,](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/mail_tracker_for_gmail/888949007475?flow_type=2) which installs directly from the Workspace Marketplace and works seamlessly inside your inbox.\
We also offer a [**Chrome Extension**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gmailtrack/glkmdbkjgjeacahocnjkglbpiagfgeko) that delivers the same tracking functionality in a browser-based experience.

Both versions work independently and provide the same reliable performance.
