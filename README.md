## Overview

[**Mail Track for Gmail** ](https://mailtrack.email)lets you know when your emails have been opened and read.

We have an holistic approach: we think that our email tracking tool should be available on all platforms: so  our product is composed of a [**Chrome extension** ](./#install-our-chrome-extension)and a  [**Google Workspace add-on**](./#install-our-google-workspace-add-on), **each of them are perfectly working separately**.
