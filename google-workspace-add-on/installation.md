There are two known issues that we can't fix, as it doesn't depend on Mail Track for Gmail:

**1- The add-on doesn't seem to be installed successfully / I never get the "add-on installed successfully" popup:**

This issue can occur when you sign in to Google accounts, and you are not using the principal account for installation. An easy workaround is to open a private window, sign in to the Google account you want, and then proceed to the installation.

**2- After successful installation, Mail Track is not visible in Gmail:**

Simply refresh Gmail, wait for 10 seconds, and it should appear in the menu!
